      <description>&lt;p&gt;Consider an $$n+1$$ dimensional matrix as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$&#xA;A = \begin{pmatrix}&#xA;\frac{\pi^2}{6} &amp; 1 &amp; \frac{1}{4} &amp; ... &amp; \frac{1}{n^2} \\&#xA;1 &amp; \frac{\pi^2}{6} &amp; \frac{1}{4} &amp; ... &amp; \frac{1}{n^2} \\&#xA;\vdots &amp; &amp; \ddots &amp; &amp; \vdots\\&#xA;1 &amp; \frac{1}{4} &amp; ... &amp; \frac{1}{n^2}  &amp;\frac{\pi^2}{6} \\&#xA;\end{pmatrix} $$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is the matrix positive-definite?&#xA;The problem itself is a dramatization of how &#xA;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://engineering.purdue.edu/AAE/people/ptProfile?resource_id&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;my professor&lt;/a&gt; would ask us to write arbitrary real matrices and quickly determine its positive-definiteness (most of the times) as a trick, seemingly like in-class wizardry!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MLP Approximation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost always we hear about classification or machine learning problems, the go-to methods to solve the problem are neural networks, or multi-layered percetrons (MLP).&#xA;Now function approximation problems, which is what classification is, are very well defined in terms of consistency, accuracy, and other abilities of the approximator.&#xA;Why are MLPs then able to approximate functions well? Especially given the fact that most of the problems in coming up with candidate architectures, activation functions, etc. are &amp;lsquo;design problems&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Real Analysis Notes</title>
      <link>http://localhost:49810/blog/my-real-notes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I took the course on Real Analysis, it made me very nervous. I was having fever dreams from the past when I took undergraduate real analysis and the epsilon-delta definitions just did not make a lot of sense. In retrospect, taking MA504 has been one of the best academic decisions, especially as an engineer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has helped me a lot in how to concretely formulate definitions, and what &amp;lsquo;approaching&amp;rsquo;, &amp;rsquo;tending&amp;rsquo;, &amp;rsquo;limiting&amp;rsquo;, and other weasel words mean in a mathematical sense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>But why is Compactness important?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:49810/blog/compactness2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my &#xA;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:49810/blog/compactness&#34;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; I touched upon the intuition behind topological compactness. We as engineers often hear about the word &amp;lsquo;compact&amp;rsquo; as a soft gatekeeping tool from doing serious mathematics. In this post we see why the understanding is very important for doing any mathematics, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; as engineers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recall the open cover definition of a compact set as the existence of a finite open subcover for any given open cover of the set. Note that the key words here are that the subcover is going to be finite, no matter which infinite cover we begin with. Let us keep that in mind. Now we often hear about compactness being a more subtle form of finiteness, or compactness abstracting the idea of being finite, or the two being related. The open cover definition lets us understand that slightly better. Open sets, being the building blocks of topology, give us a way to interact with &lt;em&gt;a specific class of sets in a finite manner&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It is this class of sets that we call compact.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Compactness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a non-mathematical note on what I understand about compactness and what it means for a set or a space to be compact.&#xA;The open cover definition is one that can be found in any textbook, but what does it &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt; for a set to be &lt;em&gt;compact?&lt;/em&gt; Why are such sets called compact? And how do compact sets differ from those which are not?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the terminology here is very carefully chosen. For once, mathematicians came up with a term that paints a succinct, abstract picture. To understand compactness,let us look at two other  properties: &lt;em&gt;limit points&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;closed sets&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Point Estimation Problem</title>
      <link>http://localhost:49810/blog/pointestimate/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It might seem out of place that in the world of big data, finding a singular parameter&amp;rsquo;s estimate could be interesting. Quite the contrary &amp;ndash; &lt;strong&gt;point estimation problems&lt;/strong&gt; are one of the most ubiquitous parametric estimation problems that arise whether you are doing your Stat Inference 101 assignments, or dealing with $$10^8$$ rows in a parquet file. And so, I thought of making this post to look further into the point estimation problems, and when might one want to use which method.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
