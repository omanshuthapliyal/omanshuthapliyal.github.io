    <br> I also like playing board games and Dungeons & Dragons with my party. <s>I am currently trying to level up my Half - Elf Bard</s> RIP, Rye Bread. I love live music and am generally into progressive rock. I also play a little myself. Friends often find me playing my guitar or ukulele before I am forced to shut down. I also play some video games from time to time. If I really want to waste a day, I fire up a game of Sid Meierâ€™s Civilization (V over VI; eagerly waiting for VII). </p>'

## Hello!


I am an Urban Air Mobility (UAM) Researcher at Hitachi America Ltd., working on problems relating to Safe Control Synthesis and Data-Driven Control.

I hold a Ph.D. in Aeronautics & Astronautics Engineering, from Purdue University, West Lafayette with a concentration in **Autonomy & Controls**. 
I was advised by [Prof. Inseok Hwang](https://engineering.purdue.edu/AAE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=1403) and [Prof. Arthur Frazho](https://engineering.purdue.edu/AAE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=1339). Prior to that, I worked with the [MathWorks Inc.](https://www.mathworks.com) at Natick, Massachusetts, before which, I did my M.S. in Aeronautics & Astronautics Engineering from Purdue University, and B.Tech. in Aerospace Engineering from [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/aero/).
